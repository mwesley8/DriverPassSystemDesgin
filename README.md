# DriverPassSystemDesgin

This project is for one of our new clients. Driver Pass is a newly created company that wants to market to customers at the DMV. The purpose of this project is the client/owner, Liam, wants to design a system to fill a void in the market when it comes to training students for the driving test at their local DMV. 
Driver Pass wants a system that can provide better driver training to prevent its customers from failing their driving tests at the DMV. Ultimately, Driver Pass would like us to build a system that:

Will enable customers to take online classes and practice tests.
Handles requests and scheduling for on-the road-training.
Provides access to company data to create, update, and delete from anywhere online.
The system will be hosted in a web-based distributed environment in the cloud.

The functional, structural, and behavioral diagrams went well. I am satisfied with the use case diagram, activity diagram, sequence diagram, and UML diagram. I would improve the sequence/activity diagram to include user actions and system responses after three consecutive invalid login attempts. I interpreted the userâ€™s needs with the use of the client interview transcript, the creation of use case diagrams, and functional requirements based on user inputs. Designing a system based on user needs enhances the probability of client/customer satisfaction. I noticed that software and system design overlap in various ways. I will approach software design using an agile adaptation of requirements, analysis, design, and implementation. System design will encompass function/non-functional requirements, assumptions, limitations, and rationale.
